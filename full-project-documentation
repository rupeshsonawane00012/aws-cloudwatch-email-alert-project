AWS CloudWatch EC2 Monitoring with Email Alert
Project Documentation
1. Introduction
This project demonstrates how to monitor an Amazon EC2 instance using Amazon CloudWatch and configure automated email notifications when CPU utilization exceeds a predefined threshold.
The objective of this project is to implement real-time infrastructure monitoring and proactive incident response using AWS services.

2. Project Objective
Monitor EC2 CPU utilization
Create CloudWatch alarm for threshold breach
Send automatic email alerts
Demonstrate AWS monitoring workflow

3. Services Used
Amazon EC2
Amazon CloudWatch
Amazon SNS
Linux (Ubuntu)
Stress Tool

4. Architecture Overview

Workflow:
EC2 Instance → CloudWatch Metric → CloudWatch Alarm → SNS Topic → Email Notification

5. Prerequisites

AWS Account
Running EC2 instance
Email address for alerts
Basic Linux command knowledge

6. Implementation Steps
Step 1: Launch EC2 Instance

Login to AWS Management Console
Navigate to EC2 Dashboard
Launch Ubuntu Instance
Configure Security Group
Verify instance is running

Step 2: Enable Detailed Monitoring

Select EC2 Instance
Click Actions → Monitor → Enable Detailed Monitoring
This allows more frequent metric collection.

Step 3: Create CloudWatch Alarm

Open CloudWatch Console
Navigate to Alarms → Create Alarm
Select metric:
EC2 → Per Instance Metrics → CPUUtilization

Step 4: Configure Threshold

Threshold Type: Static
Condition: Greater than threshold
Value: 40%
Alarm will trigger when CPU exceeds 40%.

Step 5: Configure Notification

Create new SNS Topic
Enter Topic Name
Add Email Address
Confirm subscription via email

Step 6: Add Alarm Details

Alarm Name: Email
Description: CPU Monitoring Alert
Initially alarm state shows Insufficient Data.

Step 7: Generate CPU Load

Connect to EC2 via SSH and install stress:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install stress -y

Run command:

stress --cpu 8 --timeout 1000

Step 8: Verify CPU Usage

Run:top

Observe increased CPU usage.

Step 9: Alarm Triggered
CloudWatch alarm state changes:
OK → ALARM

Step 10: Email Notification Received
SNS sends alert email containing:
Alarm Name
Instance Details
Timestamp
Metric Information

7. Outcome

Real-time monitoring implemented
Automated alerting configured
Reduced risk of downtime
Demonstrated AWS operational monitoring

8. Skills Demonstrated

AWS EC2 Monitoring
CloudWatch Metrics & Alarms
SNS Integration
Linux Performance Testing
Incident Response Automation

9. Conclusion

This project validates the implementation of automated monitoring and alerting using AWS CloudWatch and SNS. It demonstrates practical knowledge of cloud infrastructure observability.

10. Future Enhancements

Integrate Auto Scaling Group
Implement Load Balancer
Use Terraform for automation
Monitor multiple instances
